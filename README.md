# LongerCraftingParts

HOW DOES THIS WORK?
Uniform scalling is achieved by modyfing at runtime **instructions** of correct class and by modyfing the **ifstatement** to add another **or** **statement** to inlcude blade and scale it uniformly.

Longer weapons are achieved by modyfing the arguments passed to the class.

This mod allows to craft longer parts on all craftable weapons. Parts can vary from 10% to 300% size. It does not affect bought or lootable weapons, only craftable weapons can be longer.
Now comes with uniform scaling aka bigger parts. If turned on, blade will no longer grow in length only but in width too.

Weapon stats are automatically scaled which means certain weapons can be very slow, so use witch caution, very good on coachable lances, especially if you have Realistic Battle Mod.
WORKS FINE WITH RBM I USE IT MYSELF. IS COMPATIBILIE WITH EVERYTHING EXCEPT IF IT ALSO CHANGES CRAFTING WEAPON SIZE.

If you get a weapon gap bug that is not bug caused by my mod but by vanilla in game bug. In fact there are several, 1 line of code forces all crafted blades to 100% regardless of what you choose. Some other blades have incorrect mesh while others incorrect length in xml file.

WITH UNIFORM SCALLING, ALREADY CRAFTED WEAPONS WILL ALSO BECOME UNIFORM. ALL WEAPONS WIï»¿LL REVERT ONCE THE SETTING IS TURNED OFF. REQUIRES GAME RESTART ON CHANGE

It REQUIRES Harmony and Mod Configuration Menu. Can be safely turned on/off mid game, weapons will retain their size. By default allows 150% increase, can be changed to anything from 60% to 300% in Mod menu.
